# MudBlazor.Extensions.CodeGator Adapter

This is a small package to combine [CG.Blazor.Forms](https://github.com/CodeGator/CG.Blazor.Forms._MudBlazor) with the [MudExObjectEdit](https://github.com/fgilde/MudBlazor.Extensions/blob/main/MudBlazor.Extensions/Docs/ObjectEdit.md)

With this package you can keep all you CodeGator attributes on your property but use the MudExObjectEdit component from [MudBlazor.Extensions](https://www.mudex.org) to render the form.
